# Automated Recruitment Process

## Overview

This project implements an automated recruitment process using Python, NLTK (Natural Language Toolkit), Flask, Google Colab, HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The system facilitates the screening of resumes, extracting relevant information, and making preliminary assessments of candidates.

## Features

- **Resume Parsing:** Utilizes NLTK for natural language processing to extract key information from resumes.
- **Web Interface:** Implements a user-friendly web interface using Flask for seamless interaction with the system.
- **Collaborative Development:** Leverages Google Colab for collaborative development and testing of machine learning components.
- **Interactive Frontend:** Engages candidates with a dynamic HTML, CSS, and JavaScript frontend for a smooth user experience.

## Prerequisites

- Python 3.x
- Flask
- NLTK
- Google Colab account
- Web browser with JavaScript support
